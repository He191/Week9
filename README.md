I managed to complete MVP with lots of efforts. I did not get time to attempt any stretch goals. 
I learned how to use next js server and client components, initially I struggle a lot. But after watch few videos and reading docs, I managed to do it.

I used forms and button to record review and order details.

A lot of time spend on how to use context so that all pages can access cart data. Can you please check if the way I have solved is right?
